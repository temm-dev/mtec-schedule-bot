# mtec-schedule-bot

_Unofficial volunteer project_ \
_Created on the initiative of a student for students_

This is a bot created to help students keep track of appearances and schedule changes.


## üí° Idea

The user opens the bot in telegram, selects his study group, after which the current schedule and changes in pairs in the schedule (if any) will be automatically sent to him.

In addition, there are additional functions for the convenience of students.
